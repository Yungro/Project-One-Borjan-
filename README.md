# This game is to be written purely in Java! #
Borjan is supposed to be a game based on minecraft, but it will be different in various ways:
* The point of the game is to make an adventure map
* The world will generate differently
* There will be a tool used to edit the map. The tool is basically a 3-d interface, where you can edit the world without taking that much time. You can remove lots of blocks at once and add blocks quickly.
* There is an option to make new tools in the interface for making the map.
* It is possible to copy and paste objects that were made.
* This is essentially a mod.
